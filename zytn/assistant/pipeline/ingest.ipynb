       " Document(metadata={'Page number': 1}, page_content='\\n1.1BACKGROUNDThehistory of industrial automation is characterized by periods of rapid change inpopular methods. Either as a cause or, perhaps, an effect, such periods of change inautomation techniques seem closely tied to world economics. Use of the industrialrobot, which became identifiable as a unique device in the 1960s [1], along withcomputer-aided design (CAD) systems and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)systems, characterizes the latest trends in the automation of the manufacturingprocess. These technologies are leading industrial automation through anothertransition, the scope of which is stifi unknown [2].In North America, there was much adoption of robotic equipment in the early1980s, followed by a brief pull-back in the late 1980s. Since that time, the market hasbeen growing (Fig. 1.1), although it is subject to economic swings, as are all markets.Figure 1.2 shows the number of robots being installed per year in the majorindustrial regions of the world. Note that Japan reports numbers somewhat dif-ferently from the way that other regions do: they count some machines as robotsthat in other parts of the world are not considered robots (rather, they would besimply considered \"factory machines\"). Hence, the numbers reported for Japan aresomewhat inflated.A major reason for the growth in the use of industrial robots is their decliningcost. Figure 1.3 indicates that, through the decade of the 1990s, robot prices droppedwhile human labor costs increased. Also, robots are not just getting cheaper, theyare becoming more effective—faster, more accurate, more flexible. If we factorthese quality adjustments into the numbers, the cost of using robots is dropping evenfaster than their price tag is. As robots become more cost effective at their jobs,and as human labor continues to become more expensive, more and more industrialjobs become candidates for robotic automation. This is the single most importanttrend propelling growth of the industrial robot market. A secondary trend is that,economics aside, as robots become more capable they become able to do more andmore tasks that might be dangerous or impossible for human workers to perform.The applications that industrial robots perform are gradually getting moresophisticated, but it is stifi the case that, in the year 2000, approximately 78%of the robots installed in the US were welding or material-handling robots [3].'),\n",

Exactlywhat constitutes anindustrial robot is sometimes debated. Devices such as that shown in Fig. 1.4 arealways included, while numerically controlled (NC) milling machines are usuallynot. The distinction lies somewhere in the sophistication of the programmability ofthe device—if a mechanical device can be programmed to perform a wide varietyof applications, it is probably an industrial robot. Machines which are for the mostpart limited to one class of task are considered fixed automation. Forthe purposesof this text, the distinctions need not be debated; most material is of a basic naturethat applies to a wide variety of programmable machines.By and large, the study of the mechanics and control of manipulators isnot a new science, but merely a collection of topics taken from \"classical\" fields.Mechanical engineering contributes methodologies for the study of machines instatic and dynamic situations. Mathematics supplies tools for describing spatialmotions and other attributes of manipulators. Control theory provides tools fordesigning and evaluating algorithms to realize desired motions or force applications.Electrical-engineering techniques are brought to bear in the design of sensorsand interfaces for industrial robots, and computer science contributes a basis forprogramming these devices to perform a desired task.'),\n",

These objects are the links of the manipulator, the partsand tools with which it deals, and other objects in the manipulator's environment.At a crude but important level, these objects are described by just two attributes:position and orientation. Naturally, one topic of immediate interest is the mannerin which we represent these quantities and manipulate them mathematically.In order to describe the position and orientation of a body in space, we wifialways attach a coordinate system, or frame, rigidly to the object. We then proceedto describe the position and orientation of this frame with respect to some referencecoordinate system. (See Fig. 1.5.)Any frame can serve as a reference system within which to express theposition and orientation of a body, so we often think of transforming or changingthe description of these attributes of a body from one frame to another. Chapter 2discusses conventions and methodologies for dealing with the description of positionand orientation and the mathematics of manipulating these quantities with respectto various coordinate systems.Developing good skifis concerning the description of position and rotation ofrigid bodies is highly useful even in fields outside of robotics.Forward kinematics of manipulatorsKinematics is the science of motion that treats motion without regard to the forceswhich cause it.

Hence, the study of the kinematics of manipulatorsrefers to all the geometrical and time-based properties of the motion.Manipulators consist of nearly rigid links, which are connected by joints thatallow relative motion of neighboring links. These joints are usually instrumentedwith position sensors, which allow the relative position of neighboring links to bemeasured. In the case of rotary or revolute joints, these displacements are calledjoint angles. Some manipulators contain sliding (or prismatic) joints, in which therelative displacement between links is a translation, sometimes called the jointoffset.The number of degrees of freedom that a manipulator possesses is the numberof independent position variables that would have to be specified in order to locateall parts of the mechanism. This is a general term used for any mechanism. Forexample, a four-bar linkage has only one degree of freedom (even though thereare three moving members). In the case of typical industrial robots, because amanipulator is usually an open kinematic chain, and because each joint position isusually defined with a single variable, the number of joints equals the number ofdegrees of freedom.At the free end of the chain of links that make up the manipulator is the end-effector. Depending on the intended application of the robot, the end-effector couldbe a gripper, a welding torch, an electromagnet, or another device. We generallydescribe the position of the manipulator by giving a description of the tool frame,which is attached to the end-effector, relative to the base frame, which is attachedto the nonmoving base of the manipulator. (See Fig. 1.6.)A very basic problem in the study of mechanical manipulation is called forwardkinematics. This is the static geometrical problem of computing the position andorientation of the end-effector of the manipulator. Specifically, given a set of joint'),\n",

This problemis posed as follows: Given the position and orientation of the end-effector of themanipulator, calculate all possible sets of joint angles that could be used to attainthis given position and orientation. (See Fig. 1.7.) This is a fundamental problem inthe practical use of manipulators.This is a rather complicated geometrical problem that is routinely solvedthousands of times daily in human and other biological systems. In the case of anartificial system like a robot, we wifi need to create an algorithm in the controlcomputer that can make this calculation. In some ways, solution of this problem isthe most important element in a manipulator system.We can think of this problem as a mapping of \"locations\" in 3-D Cartesianspace to \"locations\" in the robot\\'s internal joint space. This need naturally arisesanytime a goal is specified in external 3-D space coordinates. Some early robotslacked this algorithm—they were simply moved (sometimes by hand) to desiredlocations, which were then recorded as a set of joint values (i.e., as a location injoint space) for later playback.

These days, however, it is rare to find anindustrial robot that lacks this basic inverse kinematic algorithm.The inverse kinematics problem is not as simple as the forward kinematicsone. Because the kinematic equations are nonlinear, their solution is not alwayseasy (or even possible) in a closed form. Also, questions about the existence of asolution and about multiple solutions arise.Study of these issues gives one an appreciation for what the human mind andnervous system are accomplishing when we, seemingly without conscious thought,move and manipulate objects with our arms and hands.The existence or nonexistence of a kinematic solution defines the workspaceofa given manipulator. The lack of a solution means that the manipulator cannotattain the desired position and orientation because it lies outside of the manipulator'sworkspace.Velocities, static forces, singularitiesIn addition to dealing with static positioning problems, we may wish to analyzemanipulators in motion. Often, in performing velocity analysis of a mechanism, it isconvenient to define a matrix quantity called the Jacobian of the manipulator. TheJacobian specifies a mapping from velocities in joint space to velocities in Cartesianspace. (See Fig. 1.8.) The nature of this mapping changes as the configuration ofthe manipulator varies. At certain points, called singularities, this mapping is notinvertible. An understanding of the phenomenon is important to designers and usersof manipulators.Consider the rear gunner in a World War I—vintage biplane fighter plane(ifiustrated in Fig. 1.9). While the pilot ifies the plane from the front cockpit, the reargunner's job is to shoot at enemy aircraft. To perform this task, his gun is mountedin a mechanism that rotates about two axes, the motions being called azimuth andelevation. Using these two motions (two degrees of freedom), the gunner can directhis stream of bullets in any direction he desires in the upper hemisphere.\"),\n",

We know we need two degreesof freedom to orient the stream of bullets, but, at this point, we have lost theeffective use of one of the joints. Our mechanism has become locally degenerateat this location and behaves as if it only has one degree of freedom (the elevationdirection).This kind of phenomenon is caused by what is called a singularity of themechanism. All mechanisms are prone to these difficulties, including robots. Justas with the rear gunner's mechanism, these singularity conditions do not preventa robot arm from positioning anywhere within its workspace. However, they cancause problems with motions of the arm in their neighborhood.Manipulators do not always move through space; sometimes they are alsorequired to touch a workpiece or work surface and apply a static force. In thiscase the problem arises: Given a desired contact force and moment, what set ofjoint torques is required to generate them? Once again, the Jacobian matrix of themanipulator arises quite naturally in the solution of this problem.DynamicsDynamics is a huge field of study devoted to studying the forces required to causemotion. In order to accelerate a manipulator from rest, glide at a constant end-effector velocity, and finally decelerate to a stop, a complex set of torque functionsmust be applied by the joint actuators.2 The exact form of the required functions ofactuator torque depend on the spatial and temporal attributes of the path taken bythe end-effector and on the mass properties of the links and payload, friction in thejoints, and so on. One method of controlling a manipulator to follow a desired pathinvolves calculating these actuator torque functions by using the dynamic equationsof motion of the manipulator.Many of us have experienced lifting an object that is actually much lighterthan we(e.g., getting a container of milk from the refrigerator whichwe thought was full, but was nearly empty). Such a misjudgment of payload cancause an unusual lifting motion. This kind of observation indicates that the humancontrol system is more sophisticated than a purely kinematic scheme. Rather, ourmanipulation control system makes use of knowledge of mass and other dynamiceffects. Likewise, algorithms that we construct to the motions of a robotmanipulator should take dynamics into account.A second use of the dynamic equations of motion is in simulation. By refor-mulating the dynamic equations so that acceleration is computed as a function ofactuator torque, it is possible to simulate how a manipulator would move underapplication of a set of actuator torques. (See Fig. 1.10.) As computing powerbecomes more and more cost effective, the use of simulations is growing in use andimportance in many fields.In Chapter 6, we develop dynamic equations of motion, which may be used tocontrol or simulate the motion of manipulators.2We use joint actuators as the generic term for devices that power a manipulator—for example,electric motors, hydraulic and pneumatic actuators, and muscles.\"),\n",

Commonly, each joint starts and ends its motion at the same time, so thattheappears coordinated. Exactly how to compute these motionfunctions is the problem of trajectory generation. (See Fig. 1.11.)Often, a path is described not only by a desired destination but also by someintermediate locations, or via points, through which the manipulator must pass enroute to the destination. In such instances the term spline is sometimes used to referto a smooth function that passes through a set of via points.In order to force the end-effector to follow a straight line (or other geometricshape) through space, the desired motion must be converted to an equivalent setof joint motions. This Cartesian trajectory generation wifi also be considered inChapter 7.Manipulatordesign and sensorsAlthoughmanipulators are, in theory, universal devices applicable to many situ-ations, economics generally dictates that the intended task domain influence themechanical design of the manipulator. Along with issues such as size, speed, andload capability, the designer must also consider the number of joints and theirgeometric arrangement. These considerations affect the manipulator's workspacesize and quality, the stiffness of the manipulator structure, and other attributes.The more joints a robot arm contains, the more dextrous and capable it wifibe.

For example, a specialized robot designed solely toplace electronic components on a flat circuit board does not need to have morethan four joints. Three joints allow the position of the hand to attain any positionin three-dimensional space, with a fourth joint added to allow the hand to rotatethe grasped component about a vertical axis. In the case of a universal robot, it isinteresting that fundamental properties of the physical world we live in dictate the\"correct\" minimum number of joints—that minimum number is six.Integral to the design of the manipulator are issues involving the choice andlocation of actuators, transmission systems, and internal-position (and sometimesforce) sensors. (See Fig. 1.12.) These and other design issues will be discussed inChapter 8.Linearposition controlSomemanipulators are equipped with stepper motors or other actuators that canexecute a desired trajectory directly. However, the vast majority of manipulatorsare driven by actuators that supply a force or a torque to cause motion of the links.In this case, an algorithm is needed to compute torques that will cause the desiredmotion. The problem of dynamics is central to the design of such algorithms, butdoes not in itself constitute a solution. A primary concern of a position controlsystemis to compensate automatically for errors in knowledge of the parametersof a system and to suppress disturbances that tend to perturb the system from thedesired trajectory. To accomplish this, position and velocity sensors are monitoredby the controlalgorithm,which computes torque commands for the actuators. (See03A'),\n",

Force control is complementary to position control, inthat we usually think of only one or the other as applicable in a certain situation.When a manipulator is moving in free space, only position control makes sense,because there is no surface to react against. When a manipulator is touching arigid surface, however, position-control schemes can cause excessive forces to buildup at the contact or cause contact to be lost with the surface when it was desiredfor some application. Manipulators are rarely constrained by reaction surfaces inall directions simultaneously, so a mixed or hybrid control is required, with somedirections controlled by a position-control law and remaining directions controlledby a force-control law. (See Fig. 1.14.) Chapter 11 introduces a methodology forimplementing such a force-control scheme.A robot should be instructed to wash a window by maintaining a certainforce in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the glass, while following amotion trajectory in directions tangent to the plane.

Viapoints are specified relative to the reference coordinate system and denote locationsalong the path through which the TCP should pass.

Sometimes, other modifiers can also be specified toaffect the motion of the robot (e.g., different smoothness criteria, etc.).

Acommon argument raised in their favor is that an off-line programming system wifinot cause production equipment (i.e., the robot) to be tied up when it needs to bereprogrammed; hence, automated factories can stay in production mode a greaterpercentage of the time. (See Fig. 1.16.)They also serve as a natural vehicle to tie computer-aided design (CAD) databases used in the design phase of a product to the actual manufacturing of theproduct.

In this book, we use thefollowing conventions:1. Usually, variables written in uppercase represent vectors or matrices. Lower-case variables are scalars.2. Leading subscripts and superscripts identify which coordinate system a quantityis written in. For example,A P representsa position vector written in coordinatesystem {A}, and R is a rotation matrix3 that specifies the relationship betweencoordinate systems {A} and {B}.3. Trailing superscripts are used (as widely accepted) for indicating the inverseor transpose of a matrix (e.g., R1, RT).4. Trailing subscripts are not subject to any strict convention but may indicate avector component (e.g., x, y, or z) or maybe used as a description—as inthe position of a bolt.5. We will use many trigonometric fi.mctions. Our notation for the cosine of ananglemay take any of the following forms: cos =c01 = c1.Vectorsare taken to be column vectors; hence, row vectors wifi have thetranspose indicated explicitly.A note on vector notation in general: Many mechanics texts treat vectorquantities at a very abstract level and routinely use vectors defined relative todifferent coordinate systems in expressions. The clearest example is that of additionof vectors which are given or known relative to differing reference systems. This isoften very convenient and leads to compact and somewhat elegant formulas. Forexample, consider the angular velocity, 0w4 ofthe last body in a series connectionof four rigid bodies (as in the links of a manipulator) relative to the fixed base of thechain. Because angular velocities sum vectorially, we may write a very simple vectorequation for the angular velocity of the final link:=++ 2w3 + (1.1)However, unless these quantities are expressed with respect to a common coordinatesystem, they cannot be summed, and so, though elegant, equation (1.1) has hiddenmuch of the \"work\" of the computation. For the particular case of the study ofmechanical manipulators, statements like that of (1.1) hide the chore of bookkeepingof coordinate systems, which is often the very idea that we need to deal with in practice.Therefore, in this book, we carry frame-of-reference information in the nota-tion for vectors, and we do not sum vectors unless they are in the same coordinatesystem. In this way, we derive expressions that solve the \"bookkeeping\" problemand can be applied directly to actual numerical computation.'),\n",

This naturally leads to a need forrepresenting positions and orientations of parts, of tools, and of the mechanismitself. To define and manipulate mathematical quantities that represent positionand orientation, we must define coordinate systems and develop conventions forrepresentation. Many of the ideas developed here in the context of position andorientation will form a basis for our later consideration of linear and rotationalvelocities, forces, and torques.We adopt the philosophy that somewhere there is a universe coordinate systemto which everything we discuss can be referenced. We wifi describe all positionsand orientations with respect to the universe coordinate system or with respect toother Cartesian coordinate systems that are (or could be) defined relative to theuniverse system.2.2DESCRIPTIONS: POSITIONS, ORIENTATIONS, AND FRAMESAdescription is used to specify attributes of various objects with which a manipula-tion system deals. These objects are parts, tools, and the manipulator itself. In thissection, we discuss the description of positions, of orientations, and of an entity thatcontains both of these descriptions: the frame.'),\n",

Because we wifi often define many coordinate systems inaddition to the universe coordinate system, vectors must be tagged with informationidentifying which coordinate system they are defined within. In this book, vectorsare written with a leading superscript indicating the coordinate system to whichthey are referenced (unless it is clear from context)—for example, Ap This meansthat the components of A P have numerical values that indicate distances along theaxes of {A}. Each of these distances along an axis can be thought of as the result ofprojecting the vector onto the corresponding axis.Figure 2.1 pictorially represents a coordinate system, {A}, with three mutuallyorthogonal unit vectors with solid heads. A point A P is represented as a vector andcan equivalently be thought of as a position in space, or simply as an ordered set ofthree numbers. Individual elements of a vector are given the subscripts x, y, and z:r1.

The situation of a position and an orientation pair arises so often in roboticsthat we define an entity called a frame, which is a set of four vectors giving positionand orientation information. For example, in Fig. 2.2, one vector locates the fingertipposition and three more describe its orientation. Equivalently, the description of aframe can be thought of as a position vector and a rotation matrix. Note that a frameis a coordinate system where, in addition to the orientation, we give a position vectorwhich locates its origin relative to some other embedding frame. For example, frame{B} is described byand Awhere ApBORG is the vector that locates theorigin of the frame {B}:{B} = (2.8)In Fig. 2.3, there are three frames that are shown along with the universe coordinatesystem. Frames {A} and {B} are known relative to the universe coordinate system,and frame {C} is known relative to frame {A}.In Fig. 2.3, we introduce a graphical representation of frames, which is conve-nient in visualizing frames. A frame is depicted by three arrows representing unitvectors defining the principal axes of the frame. An arrow representing a vector isdrawn from one origin to another. This vector represents the position of the originat the head of the arrow in tenns of the frame at the tail of the arrow. The directionof this locating arrow tells us, for example, in Fig. 2.3, that {C} is known relative to{A} and not vice versa.In summary, a frame can be used as a description of one coordinate systemrelative to another. A frame encompasses two ideas by representing both positionand orientation and so may be thought of as a generalization of those two ideas.Positions could be represented by a frame whose rotation-matrix part is the identitymatrix and whose position-vector part locates the point being described.

The previous sectionintroduced descriptions of positions, orientations, and frames; we now consider themathematics of mapping in order to change descriptions from frame to frame.Mappingsinvolving translated framesInFig. 2.4, we have a position defined by the vector We wish to express thispoint in space in terms of frame {A}, when {A} has the same orientation as {B}. Inthis case, {B} differs from {A} only by a translation, which is given by ApBORG, avector that locates the origin of {B} relative to {A}.Because both vectors are defined relative to frames of the same orientation,we calculate the description of point P relative to {A}, Ap, byvector addition:A _BA—+BORG (2.9)Note that only in the special case of equivalent orientations may we add vectors thatare defined in terms of different frames.In this simple example, we have illustrated mapping a vector from one frameto another. This idea of mapping, or changing the description from one frame toanother, is an extremely important concept. The quantity itself (here, a point inspace) is not changed; only its description is changed. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.4,where the point described by B P is not translated, but remains the same, and insteadwe have computed a new description of the same point, but now with respect tosystem {A}.'),\n",

For convenience,we stack these three unit vectors together as the columns of a 3 x 3 matrix. We wificall this matrix a rotation matrix, and, if this particular rotation matrix describes {B}relative to {A}, we name it with the notationNote that, by our definition, the columns of a rotation matrix all have unitmagnitude, and, further, that these unit vectors are orthogonal.

This aids in writing compact equations and is conceptuallyclearer than (2.17). In order that we may write the mathematics given in (2.17) inthe matrix operator form suggested by (2.18), we define a 4 x 4 matrix operator anduse 4 x 1 position vectors, so that (2.18) has the structure[Ap1[APBQRG1[Bpl (2.19) L1J[0 001]L1jIn other words,1. a \"1\" is added as the last element of the 4 x 1 vectors;2. a row \"[0001]\" is added as the last row of the 4 x 4 matrix.We adopt the convention that a position vector is 3 x 1 or 4 x 1, depending onwhether it appears multiplied by a 3 x 3 matrix or by a 4 x 4 matrix. It is readilyseen that (2.19) implementsAp=Bp+ ApBQRQ1 =1. (2.20)The 4 x 4 matrix in (2.19) is called a homogeneous transform. For our purposes,it can be regarded purely as a construction used to cast the rotation and translationof the general transform into a single matrix form. In other fields of study, it can beused to compute perspective and scaling operations (when the last row is other than\"[0 0 0 1]\" or the rotation matrix is not orthonormal). The interested reader shouldsee [2].Often, we wifi write an equation like (2.18) without any notation indicatingthat it is a homogeneous representation, because it is obvious from context. Notethat, although homogeneous transforms are useful in writing compact equations, acomputer program to transform vectors would generally not use them, because oftime wasted multiplying ones and zeros.

This sectionillustrates this interpretation of the mathematics we have already developed.TranslationaloperatorsAtranslation moves a point in space a finite distance along a given vector direc-tion. With this interpretation of actually translating the point in space, only onecoordinate system need be involved. It turns out that translating the point in spaceis accomplished with the same mathematics as mapping the point to a secondframe. Almost always, it is very important to understand which interpretation ofthe mathematics is being used. The distinction is as simple as this: When a vector ismoved \"forward\" relative to a frame, we may consider either that the vector moved\"forward\" or that the frame moved \"backward.\" The mathematics involved in thetwo cases is identical; only our view of the situation is different. Figure 2.9 indicatespictorially how a vector A P1 is translated by a vector A Here,the vector Agivesthe information needed to perform the translation.The result of the operation is a new vector A P2, calculated asAp2 =Ap1+AQTo write this translation operation as a matrix operator, we use the notationAp2=DQ(q)Ap1(2.24)'),\n",

Usually, when a rotation matrix is shown as an operator, no sub- or superscriptsappear, because it is not viewed as relating two frames. That is, we may writeAPRAP (2.27)Again, as in the case of translations, the mathematics described in (2.13) and in(2.27) is the same; only our interpretation is different. This fact also allows us to seehow to obtain rotational matrices that are to be used as operators:The rotation matrix that rotates vectors through some rotation, R, is the same asthe rotation matrix that describes a frame rotated by R relative to the reference frame.Although a rotation matrix is easily viewed as an operator, we will also defineanother notation for a rotational operator that clearly indicates which axis is beingrotated about: Ap2=RK(O)Ap1 (2.28)In this notation, \"RK (0)\" is a rotational operator that performs a rotation aboutthe axis direction K by 0 degrees. This operator can be written as a homogeneoustransform whose position-vector part is zero.

Of these, 12 conventions are for fixed-angle sets,and 12 are for Euler-angle sets. Note that, because of the duality of fixed-anglesets with Euler-angle sets, there are really only 12 unique parameterizations of arotation matrix by using successive rotations about principal axes. There is oftenno particular reason to favor one convention over another, but various authorsadopt different ones, so it is useful to list the equivalent rotation matrices for all 24conventions.

This is an example of an equivalent angle—axisrepresentation. If the axis is a general direction (rather than one of the unit directions)any orientation may be obtained through proper axis and angle selection. Considerthe following description of a frame {B}:Start with the frame coincident with a known frame {A}; then rotate {B}about the vector AK by an angle 9 according to the right-hand rule.Vector K is sometimes called the equivalent axis of a finite rotation. A generalorientation of {B} relative to {A} may be written as 9) or RK(O) and wifibe called the equivalent angle—axis representation.4 The specification of the vectorAK requires only two parameters, because its length is always taken to be one. Theangle specifies a third parameter. Often, we wifi multiply the unit direction, K, withthe amount of rotation, 9, to form a compact 3 x 1 vector description of orientation,denoted by K (no \"hat\"). See Fig. 2.19.When the axis of rotation is chosen from among the principal axes of {A}, thenthe equivalent rotation matrix takes on the familiar form of planar rotations:[110Rx(8)=0cos9 —sin9 ,(2.77)L0sin9cos9 ]'),\n",

In fact, from the definitions in (2.88), it is clear that all e, remainin the interval [—1, 1].Taughtand predefined orientationsInmany robot systems, it wifi be possible to \"teach\" positions and orientationsby using the robot itself. The manipulator is moved to a desired location, and thisposition is recorded. A frame taught in this manner need not necessarily be one towhich the robot wifi be commanded to return; it could be a part location or a fixturelocation. In other words, the robot is used as a measuring tool having six degreesof freedom. Teaching an orientation like this completely obviates the need for thehuman programmer to deal with orientation representation at all. In the computer,the taught point is stored as a rotation matrix (or however), but the user never hasto see or understand it. Robot systems that allow teaching of frames by using therobot are thus highly recommended.Besides teaching frames, some systems have a set of predefined orientations,such as \"pointing down\" or \"pointing left.\" These specifications are very easyfor humans to deal with. However, if this were the only means of describing andspecifying orientation, the system would be very limited.2.9 TRANSFORMATION OF FREE VECTORSWe have been concerned mostly with position vectors in this chapter. In laterchapters, we wifi discuss velocity and force vectors as well. These vectors willtransform differently because they are a different type of vector.In mechanics, one makes a distinction between the equality and the equivalenceof vectors. Two vectors are equal if they have the same dimensions, magnitude, anddirection. Two vectors that are considered equal could have different lines ofaction—for example, the three equal vectors in Fig 2.21. These velocity vectorshave the same dimensions, magnitude, and direction and so are equal according toour definition.Two vectors are equivalent in a certain capacity if each produces the very sameeffect in this capacity. Thus, if the criterion in Fig. 2.21 is distance traveled, all threevectors give the same result and are thus equivalent in this capacity. If the criterion isheight above the xy plane, then the vectors are not equivalent despite their equality.Thus, relationships between vectors and notions of equivalence depend entirely onthe situation at hand. Furthermore, vectors that are not equal might cause equivalenteffects in certain cases.We wifi define two basic classes of vector quantities that might be helpful.The term linevectorrefers to a vector that is dependent on its line of action,along with direction and magnitude, for causing its effects. Often, the effects of aforce vector depend upon its line of action (or point of application), so it would thenbe considered a line vector.A free vector refers to a vector that may be positioned anywhere in space with-out loss or change of meaning, provided that magnitude and direction are preserved.'),\n",

If we have amoment vector BN that is known in terms of {B}, then we calculate the samemoment in terms of frame {A} asAN_ARBN (2.93)In other words, all that counts is the magnitude and direction (in the case of a freevector), so only the rotation matrix relating the two systems is used in transforming.The relative locations of the origins do not enter into the calculation.Likewise, a velocity vector written in {B}, Bv, iswritten in {A} asAV=BV (2.94)The velocity of a point is a free vector, so all that is important is its direction andmagnitude. The operation of rotation (as in (2.94)) does not affect the magnitude,yet accomplishes the rotation that changes the description of the vector from {B}to {A).

Within the science of kinematics, one studies the position, thevelocity, the acceleration, and all higher order derivatives of the position variables(with respect to time or any other variable(s)). Hence, the study of the kinematics ofmanipulators refers to all the geometrical and time-based properties of the motion.The relationships between these motions and the forces and torques that cause themconstitute the problem of dynamics, which is the subject of Chapter 6.In this chapter, we consider position and orientation of the manipulatorlinkages in static situations. In Chapters 5 and6, we wifi consider the kinematicswhen velocities and accelerations are involved.In order to deal with the complex geometry of a manipulator, we wifi affixframes to the various parts of the mechanism and then describe the relationshipsbetween these frames. The study of manipulator kinematics involves, among otherthings, how the locations of these frames change as the mechanism articulates. Thecentral topic of this chapter is a method to compute the position and orientation ofthe manipulator's end-effector relative to the base of the manipulator as a functionof the joint variables.3.2LINK DESCRIPTIONAmanipulator may be thought of as a set of bodies connected in a chain by joints.These bodies are called links.

Most manipulatorshave revolute joints or have sliding joints called prismatic joints. In the rare casethat a mechanism is built with a joint having n degrees of freedom, it can be modeled as n joints of one degree of freedom connected with n — 1links of zero length.Therefore, without loss of generality, we wifi consider only manipulators that havejoints with a single degree of freedom.The links are numbered starting from the immobile base of the arm, whichmight be called link 0. The first moving body is link 1, and so on, out to the freeend of the arm, which is link n. In order to position an end-effector generally in3-space, a minimum of six joints is required.1 Typical manipulators have five or sixjoints.

However, for the purposes of obtaining the kinematicequations of the mechanism, a link is considered only as a rigid body that definesthe relationship between two neighboring joint axes of a manipulator. Joint axes aredefined by lines in space. Joint axis i is defined by a line in space, or a vectordirection, about which link i rotates relative to link i 1.It turns out that, forkinematic purposes, a link can be specified with two numbers, which define therelative location of the two axes in space.For any two axes in 3-space, there exists a well-defined measure of distancebetween them. This distance is measured along a line that is mutually perpendicularto both axes. This mutual perpendicular always exists; it is unique except whenboth axes are parallel, in which case there are many mutual perpendiculars of equallength. Figure 3.2 shows link i — 1and the mutually perpendicular line along whichthe link length,is measured.

Unlike the examples we have seen thus far, the Motomanis not a simple open kinematic chain, but rather makes use of two linear actuatorscoupled to links 2 and 3 with four-bar linkages. Also, through a chain drive, joints 4and 5 are operated by two actuators in a differential arrangement.In this example, we wifi solve the kinematics in two stages. First, we wifi solvefor joint angles from actuator positions; second, we will solve for Cartesian positionand orientation of the last link from joint angles. In this second stage, we can treatthe system as if it were a simple open-kinematic-chain SR device.Figure 3.23 shows the linkage mechanism that connects actuator number 2 tolinks 2 and 3 of the robot. The actuator is a linear one that directly controls thelength of the segment labeled DC. Triangle ABC is ftxed, as is the length BD. Joint2 pivots about point B, and the actuator pivots slightly about point C as the linkagemoves.

One purpose of such alinkage arrangement is to increase the structural rigidity of the main linkages ofthe robot. This often pays off in terms of an increased ability to position the robotprecisely.The actuators for joints 4 and 5 are attached to link 1 of the robot with their axesaligned with that ofjoint 2 (points B and F in Figs. 3.23 and 3.24). They operate thewrist joints through two sets of chains—one set located interior to link 2, the secondset interior to link 3. The effect of this transmission system, along with its interactionwith the actuation of links 2 and 3, is described functionally as follows: Actuator 4is used to position joint 4 relative to the base of the robot, rather than relative to thepreceding link 3. This means that holding actuator 4 constant wifi keep link 4 at aconstant orientation relative to the base of the robot, regardless of the positions ofjoints 2 and 3. Finally, actuator 5 behaves as if directly connected to joint 5.We now state the equations that map a set of actuator values (A1) to theequivalent set of joint values (0,).

The five frames indicated inFig. 3.27 are so often referred to that we will define names for them. The namingand subsequent use of these five frames in a robot programming and control systemfacilitates providing general capabilities in an easily understandable way. All robotmotions will be described in terms of these frames.Brief definitions of the frames shown in Fig. 3.27 follow.Thebase frame, {B}{B}is located at the base of the manipulator. It is merely another name for frame{0}. It is affixed to a nonmoving part of the robot, sometimes called link 0.'),\n",

Specifically this means that, at the end of the motion, the tool frame should be brought tocoincidence with the goal frame. {G} is always specified relative to the station frame.In Fig. 3.28, the goal is located at a hole into which we want the pin to be inserted.All robot motions may be described in terms of these frames without loss of generality. Their use helps to give us a standard language for talking about robot tasks.3.9WHERE IS THE TOOL?Oneof the first capabilities a robot must have is to be able to calculate the positionand orientation of the tool it is holding (or of its empty hand) with respect to aconvenient coordinate system. That is, we wish to calculate the value of the toolframe, {T}, relative to the station frame, {S}. Once has been computed via thekinematic equations, we can use Cartesian transforms, as studied in Chapter 2, tocalculate {T} relative to {S}. Solving a simple transform equation leads to=T1 (3.18)Equation (3.18) implements what is called the WHERE function in some robotsystems. It computes \"where\" the arm is. For the situation in Fig. 3.28, the output of WHERE would be the position and orientation of the pin relative to the table top.Equation (3.18) can be thought of as generalizing the kinematics. T computesthe kinematics due to the geometry of the linkages, along with a general transform (which might be considered a fixed link) at the base end T)and another at theend-effectorThese extra transforms allow us to include tools with offsets andtwists and to operate with respect to an arbitrary station frame.3.10COMPUTATIONAL CONSIDERATIONSInmany practical manipulator systems, the time required to perform kinematiccalculations is a consideration. In this section, we briefly discuss various issuesinvolved in computing manipulator kinematics, as exemplified by (3.14), for the case of the PUMA 560.One choice to be made is the use of fixed- or floating-point representationof the quantities involved. Many implementations use floating point for ease of software development, because the programmer does not have to be concernedwith scaling operations capturing the relative magnitudes of the variables. However, when speed is crucial, fixed-point representation is quite possible, because the variables do not have a large dynamic range, and these ranges are fairly well known.Rough estimations of the number of bits needed in fixed-point representation seem to indicate that 24 are sufficient [4].By factoring equations such as (3.14), it is possible to reduce the number ofmultiplications and additions—at the cost of creating local variables (usually a good trade-off). The point is to avoid computing common terms over and over throughoutthe computation. There has been some application of computer-assisted automatic factorization of such equations [5].'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Page number': 92}, page_content='92Chapter 3Manipulator kinematicsThe majorexpense in calculating kinematics is often the calculation of thetranscendental functions (sine and cosine). When these functions are available aspart of a standard library, they are often computed from a series expansion atthe cost of many multiply times. At the expense of some required memory, manymanipulation systems employ table-lookup implementations of the transcendentalfunctions. Depending on the scheme, this reduces the amount of time required tocalculate a sine or cosine to two or three multiply times or less [6].The computation of the kinematics as in (3.14) is redundant, in that ninequantities are calculated to represent orientation. One means that usually reducescomputation is to calculate only two columns of the rotation matrix and then tocompute a cross product (requiring only six multiplications and three additions)to compute the third column. Obviously, one chooses the two least complicatedcolumns to compute.'),\n",

Rotation matrices may also be called properorthonormal matrices, where\"proper\" refers to the fact that the determinant is +1(nonproper orthonormal matrices have the determinant —1).It is natural to ask whether it is possible to describe an orientation with fewerthan nine numbers. A result from linear algebra (known as Cayley\\'s formula fororthonormal matrices [3])states that, for any proper orthonormal matrix R, thereexists a skew-symmetric matrix S such that\\nR=(13—+ 5), (2.56)where13 is a 3 x 3 unit matrix.

Equations (2.9) and (2.24) implement the same mathematics. Notethat, if we had defined BpAORG (instead of ApBORG) in Fig. 2.4 and had used it in(2.9), then we would have seen a sign change between (2.9) and (2.24). This signchange would indicate the difference between moving the vector \"forward\" andmoving the coordinate system \"backward.\" By defining the location of {B} relativeto {A} (withAwe cause the mathematics of the two interpretations to bethe same. Now that the \"DQ\" notation has been introduced, we may also use it todescribe frames and as a mapping.RotationaloperatorsAnotherinterpretation of a rotation matrix is as a rotational operator that operateson a vectorA P1 and changes that vector to a new vector,A P2, bymeans of a rotation,R. Usually, when a rotation matrix is shown as an operator, no sub- or superscriptsappear, because it is not viewed as relating two frames. That is, we may writeAPRAP (2.27)Again, as in the case of translations, the mathematics described in (2.13) and in(2.27) is the same; only our interpretation is different. This fact also allows us to seehow to obtain rotational matrices that are to be used as operators:The rotation matrix that rotates vectors through some rotation, R, is the same asthe rotation matrix that describes a frame rotated by R relative to the reference frame.Although a rotation matrix is easily viewed as an operator, we will also defineanother notation for a rotational operator that clearly indicates which axis is beingrotated about: Ap2=RK(O)Ap1 (2.28)In this notation, \"RK (0)\" is a rotational operator that performs a rotation aboutthe axis direction K by 0 degrees. This operator can be written as a homogeneoustransform whose position-vector part is zero. For example, substitution into (2.11)yields the operator that rotates about the Z axis by 0 ascos0 —sinG 0 0=[sinGcos0 (2.29)'),\n",

Having understood the general case of rotation andtranslation, we wifi not need to explicitly consider the two simpler cases since theyare contained within the general framework.As a general tool to represent frames, we have introduced the homogeneoustransform, a 4 x 4 matrix containing orientation and position information.We have introduced three interpretations of this homogeneous transform:1.It is a description of a frame. describes the frame {B} relative to the frame{A}. Specifically, the colunms of are unit vectors defining the directions ofthe principal axes of {B}, and A locates the position of the origin of {B}.2. It is a transform mapping. mapsBp -÷Ap3.Itis a transform operator. T operates on Ap1 to create Ap2From this point on, the terms frame and transform wifi both be used to referto a position vector plus an orientation. Frame is the term favored in speaking of adescription, and transform is used most frequently when function as a mapping oroperator is implied. Note that transformations are generalizations of (and subsume)translations and rotations; we wifi often use the term transform when speaking of apure rotation (or translation).2.6TRANSFORMATION ARITHMETICInthis section, we look at the multiplication of transforms and the inversion oftransforms. These two elementary operations form a functionally complete set oftransform operators.CompoundtransformationsInFig. 2.12, we have Cp and wish to find Ap')]"
